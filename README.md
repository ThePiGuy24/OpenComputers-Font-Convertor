# OpenComputers-Font-Convertor
A short but terribly written python program to convert ttf or otf fonts into hexfonts for OC.

## Usage:
```python3 font2oc.py <fontname> [font size] [x offset] [y offset]```<br>
font size should be around 12-13 in most cases, as it fits best.<br>
The resultant font.hex is places in the current working directory.

## Requirements:
